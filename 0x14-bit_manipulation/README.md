#C - Bit manipulation
##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

###General
* Look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
#### 0
#### mandatory
_Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int._

* Prototype: unsigned int binary/_to/_uint(const char *b);
where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
* Return: the converted number, or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
b is NULL
#### 1
#### mandatory
_Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number._

* Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
* You are not allowed to use arrays
* You are not allowed to use malloc
* You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
